# Rules
Portal Rush is played according to the following rules. The player can jump up using Space Key and A and D or Left and Right Arrow Keys to move foward and backward. Players try to maneuver far away from the Reaper so he won't come closer and snatch our player's soul. If a player collides with the obstacles the reaper gets a chance to come closer and closer ever time. A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen if reaper was success full in snaching the player's soul. This is a infinite runner as the game becomes faster and faster at certain check points and a suprise in the end awaits.
